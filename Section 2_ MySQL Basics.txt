        - Let's say you have a dating app, and all your user information is stored in the database. 
          The database is essentially a giant phonebook with all the information but it doesn't do anything by itself. 
          This is where the Database management system comes in. 
          It allows the app to access the database and manipulate information.

          You talk to the database management system and it talks to the database for us.
